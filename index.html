    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nikola Jokić, and I come from the world of architecture and interior design where I have spent more than 12 years creating inspiring spaces. Throughout my career in construction and renovation, I have gained invaluable experience that has taught me the art of overcoming challenges and delivering top-notch results for clients. Working in the family business in Germany for the past 7 years, alongside my brother, has further solidified my project management skills and my ability to provide the highest level of service.</p><br>
    <p>After a spinal injury resulting from years of dedicated work to meet all clients' demands, I decided to make a significant career change. I chose to return to my long-standing passion for computers and explore the world of front-end development. What drew me to the IT industry was the vast spectrum of opportunities it offers for continuous learning, personal growth, and creative expression. The combination of creativity, logical problem-solving, and technological advancement in this field motivates me to keep pushing forward and evolving as a professional.</p><br>
    <p>My passion for IT technology runs deep – it's not just superficial. I have always been fascinated by how technology can transform our world and enable us to achieve incredible things. As a front-end developer, I strive to create intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing applications that provide an exceptional user experience. I believe in the power of details and dedication to every aspect of a project, from the initial idea to final realization.</p><br>
    <p>Currently, I am working on several projects, constantly improving myself, and expanding my knowledge of the latest trends in the IT industry. I am dedicated to learning new technologies and applying them to create solutions that are not only functional but also aesthetically superior. My goal is to continuously enhance my skills and contribute to the growth of the team and the company I collaborate with.</p>
